        "answer": "Universal screeners are used to proactively identify students who are at-risk for social, emotional, and behavioral issues before problems grow and get out of control.

        "question": "What is the significance of baseline data in behavior tracking?",
        "answer": "Baseline data is crucial in behavior tracking as it provides an initial measure of the problem behavior before any interventions are implemented. This data helps in understanding the frequency, intensity, and duration of the behavior, allowing for more targeted interventions."

        "question": "What role does data play in making decisions about continuing, adjusting, or ceasing Tier 2 interventions?",
        "answer": "Data plays a critical role in making decisions about Tier 2 interventions. Progress monitoring data is used to determine whether the intervention is being implemented as intended and whether the student is benefiting from it. Based on this data, teams may decide to continue, adjust, or end the intervention, or increase support to Tier 3."

    {
        "question": "What is progress monitoring and why is it important in the MTSS framework?",
        "answer": "Progress monitoring is a process for tracking both academic and behavioral progress in students, playing a key role in the MTSS (Multi-Tiered System of Supports) framework. It is important because it helps in developing meaningful and measurable intervention plans, especially for students with Tier 3 mental health needs, and allows for adjustments in interventions based on the student's evolving needs."

    {
        "question": "What is the role of universal screening in schools?",
        "answer": "Universal screening in schools is a systematic process of administering assessments to all students to identify those who may be at risk for certain negative outcomes or in need of additional support. It is crucial for proactively identifying concerns and connecting students with early interventions and supports, thereby preventing larger issues from developing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of progress monitoring during Tier 2 interventions?",
        "answer": "Progress monitoring during Tier 2 interventions helps the MTSS team decide whether to continue or adjust interventions, return to Tier 1 support, or move to Tier 3 support."
