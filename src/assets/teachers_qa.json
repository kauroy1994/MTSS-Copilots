      "question": "What does 'fidelity' mean in the context of MTSS?",
      "answer": "'Fidelity' in the context of MTSS refers to how closely the intervention is practiced as it was originally developed. High fidelity means sticking closely to the intervention plan, which increases the likelihood of effectively addressing the student's issue. Low fidelity, where changes are made to the original intervention, may reduce its effectiveness."
