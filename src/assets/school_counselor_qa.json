      "question": "What is the MTSS framework?",
      "answer": "The Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) is a comprehensive, evidence-based framework designed to support successful student outcomes and eliminate barriers to learning. It identifies and addresses the needs of all students, including those struggling academically and behaviorally, by providing interventions and supports at varying levels of intensity. The MTSS framework guides schools in selecting and implementing appropriate curriculum and interventions based on students' needs."

      "question": "What is meant by 'tiers' in the MTSS framework?",
      "answer": "In the MTSS framework, 'tiers' refer to levels of intervention organized into three tiers. These tiers are not a ranking system; rather, each tier is important and requires careful attention and planning. The tiers represent different levels of intervention intensity to meet the diverse needs of students."

      "question": "What role does data play in making decisions about continuing, adjusting, or ceasing Tier 2 interventions?",
      "answer": "Data plays a critical role in making decisions about Tier 2 interventions. Progress monitoring data is used to determine whether the intervention is being implemented as intended and whether the student is benefiting from it. Based on this data, teams may decide to continue, adjust, or end the intervention, or increase support to Tier 3."

    {
      "question": "What are Behavior Intervention Plans (BIPs) and how are they used in schools?",
      "answer": "Behavior Intervention Plans (BIPs) in schools are formal documents developed to reduce challenging behaviors in students. BIPs are typically informed by Functional Behavioral Assessments (FBAs) and include strategies such as replacement behaviors, positive reinforcement, and environmental changes. These plans are used to support positive behavior and prevent problem behavior, often as part of a student's Individualized Education Plan (IEP)."
