        "answer": "Progress monitoring is a process for tracking both academic and behavioral progress in students, playing a key role in the MTSS (Multi-Tiered System of Supports) framework.

        "question": "What factors should be considered when selecting assessment measures for students?",
        "answer": "When selecting assessment measures for students, it is important to consider the age and developmental stage of the student, the context in which the assessment will be administered, and the use of multiple measure types. Younger children may require caregiver or teacher assessments, while older students can provide meaningful self-assessments. The setting (school or home) also influences the choice of assessments. Using multiple measure types, such as self-assessments, teacher assessments, and family assessments, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the student's wellbeing."

        "question": "What are the three types of stress discussed in the document and how do they differ?",
        "answer": "The three types of stress discussed in the document are Positive Stress, Tolerable Stress, and Toxic Stress. Positive Stress is the body's normal and healthy response to a tense situation or event, promoting adaptability and change. Tolerable Stress involves a heightened activation of the body's response to a longer-lasting or severe event, which is manageable with support. Toxic Stress occurs when the body remains in a prolonged state of heightened activation, leading to negative impacts on brain function and behavior, such as anxiety, depression, and impaired learning."

        "answer": "A collaborative safety plan in suicide prevention includes several components: identifying warning signs (moods, thoughts, or events that cause distress), listing internal coping strategies (self-soothing techniques), identifying people and places that provide distraction, listing people to ask for help during a crisis, including professionals to contact, and making the environment safer by restricting access to means of self-harm. This plan is created collaboratively between the supportive adult, the student, and caregivers, increasing the likelihood of effective implementation during a crisis."
