        "question": "What is the importance of focusing on goals that are meaningful for a student like George in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)?",
        "answer": "It is important to focus on goals that are meaningful for George because he is struggling with symptoms of depression and using emotions like anger to cope with underlying frustrations. By working on SMARTIE goals collaboratively, George’s voice is empowered, and trust and rapport are built, which are crucial for his therapeutic progress."

        "question": "What should be done when a student like George shows significant progress in reducing anger outbursts, improving grades, and becoming more comfortable sharing emotions in treatment?",
        "answer": "When a student like George shows significant progress, the intervention should evolve to meet his changing needs. This may include transitioning from twice-weekly therapy sessions to once-a-week sessions, allowing George more time to practice his newfound skills independently. Additionally, involving George more directly in setting his therapy goals can give him a sense of ownership over his progress."

        "question": "What are the main components of progress monitoring in mental health interventions?",
        "answer": "The main components of progress monitoring in mental health interventions include selecting targets that are meaningful to the student, monitoring more than just symptoms, providing feedback to the student and their family, and evolving, changing, or ending the intervention based on progress monitoring results and successes or setbacks."

        "question": "How can practitioners ensure a comprehensive view of a student's overall progress during mental health interventions?",
        "answer": "To ensure a comprehensive view of a student's overall progress, practitioners should attend to both externalizing and internalizing behaviors and their impact on other areas of the student's life. This can be achieved by gathering additional insights from teachers, using measurement tools like the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and conducting regular check-ins with the student’s family."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the considerations for ending or evolving a mental health intervention for a student?",
        "answer": "When considering whether to end or evolve a mental health intervention, it is important to assess whether the student still needs the same level of support. If the progress monitoring consistently shows successful behavior change, it may be appropriate to reduce the intensity of the intervention or even conclude it. However, if new challenges arise, the intervention may need to be adjusted to address these evolving needs."
