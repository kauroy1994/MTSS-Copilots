        "response": "Integrating mental health supports into each tier of the Multi-Tiered System of Support (MTSS) framework involves implementing best practices to address the diverse needs of students effectively. In the context of MTSS, which focuses on data-informed decision-making and evidence-based interventions, incorporating mental health supports is crucial for promoting students' well-being and academic success. School psychologists play a vital role in this process by contributing their expertise in data interpretation, progress monitoring, and effective problem-solving [Data: Sources (203)]. \n\nAt the universal screening tier of MTSS, it is essential to conduct screenings that not only assess academic performance but also include mental health indicators. By identifying students who may be at risk of mental health issues early on, schools can provide timely interventions and support. This aligns with the best practice of early identification of students at risk and promoting crisis management through proactive screening, as supported by the MTSS framework [Data: Sources (203)]. \n\nIn the implementation of evidence-based interventions at multiple tiers within MTSS, it is crucial to tailor interventions to meet the specific mental health needs of students. School psychologists can assist in designing interventions matched to student needs based on data analysis and observation. This personalized approach ensures that students receive the support that addresses their mental health concerns effectively. Moreover, ongoing progress monitoring is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions and make informed decisions about adjusting or changing strategies as needed [Data: Sources (203)]. \n\nFurthermore, school psychologists can collaborate with the school-based leadership team and staff to address mental health needs within the MTSS framework. By providing consultation and support throughout the problem-solving phases, school psychologists help ensure that mental health considerations are integrated into the decision-making process at each tier of MTSS. This collaborative approach enhances the overall effectiveness of mental health supports within the framework [Data: Sources (203)]. \n\nIn summary, the best practices for integrating mental health supports into each tier of the MTSS framework involve early identification through screenings, personalized interventions based on data analysis, ongoing progress monitoring, and collaboration among school psychologists, leadership teams, and staff to address students' mental health needs effectively. By following these practices, schools can create a supportive environment that promotes both academic achievement and mental well-being for all students.",
