        "query": "Q1. I am a school counselor in a small school in rural area. The teachers in my school are really overwhelmed with behaviors that they are experiencing in the classroom.  Students are acting out, being rude to each other and the teachers, and not listening.  How can I help support the teachers and the students? Generally, most teachers have not been given proper training to support behavioral concerns in the classroom, but the good news is that we know what to do and have the research to prove what to focus on.  We start by talking with our students about their experience and what they would like to see change and co-design approaches together.  One of the most impactful things we can do is to make sure that everyone feels a sense of connection and belonging and that includes staff. Small things like welcoming students each day and learning their name and something personal about them, setting the stage for a nurturing environment.",
        "response": "It sounds like you're facing some challenging behaviors in your school, but you're also aware of the research-based strategies to address these concerns.\n\nAs a school counselor, you can play a vital role in supporting both teachers and students in this situation. Here are some suggestions on how you can help:\n\n1. **Collaborate with teachers**: Meet with the teachers to discuss their concerns and listen to their ideas about what's working and what's not. This will help you understand their perspective and identify potential solutions.\n2. **Provide training and support**: Offer professional development opportunities for teachers on evidence-based strategies for managing classroom behaviors, such as positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS). You can also provide resources and guidance on how to create a nurturing environment in the classroom.\n3. **Develop a school-wide approach**: Work with administrators, teachers, and other staff members to develop a comprehensive plan to address the behavioral concerns. This might involve creating a school-wide PBIS system, establishing clear expectations for student behavior, and providing opportunities for students to reflect on their actions and make amends when necessary.\n4. **Focus on relationships and social-emotional learning**: As you mentioned, building connections with students and staff is crucial in creating a positive school climate. Encourage teachers to use strategies like morning greetings, small group discussions, and one-on-one interactions to build rapport with students. Also, consider incorporating social-emotional learning (SEL) into the curriculum to help students develop essential life skills like empathy, self-awareness, and self-regulation.\n5. **Empower students as problem-solvers**: As you mentioned, co-designing approaches with students can be incredibly powerful. Encourage teachers to involve students in identifying solutions to behavioral concerns and provide opportunities for them to take ownership of their actions and make positive changes.\n\nBy taking a collaborative and student-centered approach, you can help create a more supportive and inclusive school environment that addresses the needs of both teachers and students.\n\nWhich specific aspect of this scenario would you like me to elaborate on or provide additional guidance?",

        "query": "Q2. I have a student who is experiencing significant issues in the home, they are already receiving Tier 3 services from our contracted mental health professional. I want to support the student, what can I do?",
        "response": "Given that the student is already receiving Tier 3 services, it's essential to collaborate with the contracted mental health professional and other relevant stakeholders to ensure a comprehensive approach.\n\nHere are some steps you can take as a school counselor:\n\n1. **Collaborate with the contracted mental health professional**: Schedule a meeting or call with the mental health professional to discuss the student's progress, challenges, and any specific needs they've identified. This will help you understand how their services are impacting the student and what additional support might be beneficial.\n2. **Review the student's MTSS plan**: Ensure that the student's Individualized Education Program (IEP) or Section 504 Plan is up-to-date and reflects the current interventions being implemented by the mental health professional. This will help you understand how the school is supporting the student's academic, social-emotional, and behavioral needs.\n3. **Identify additional school-based supports**: Consider what other resources within the school might be beneficial for this student. For example:\n\t* Academic support: Are there any specific accommodations or modifications that can be made to help the student succeed academically?\n\t* Social-emotional support: Can you provide counseling sessions focused on coping skills, stress management, or self-esteem building?\n\t* Behavioral support: Are there any strategies that can be implemented to help the student manage their behavior and develop more positive relationships with peers and teachers?\n4. **Communicate with parents/guardians**: Keep the student's parents/guardians informed about the progress being made in Tier 3 services, as well as any additional school-based supports you're considering. This will ensure that everyone is on the same page and working together to support the student.\n5. **Document everything**: Make sure to document all interactions with the contracted mental health professional, meetings with parents/guardians, and any additional school-based supports implemented for the student.\n\nBy following these steps, you can provide a more comprehensive and supportive environment for this student, while also ensuring that their Tier 3 services are being effectively integrated into their overall educational plan.",
