        "query": "Q1. I am a school counselor in a small school in rural area. The teachers in my school are really overwhelmed with behaviors that they are experiencing in the classroom.  Students are acting out, being rude to each other and the teachers, and not listening.  How can I help support the teachers and the students? Generally, most teachers have not been given proper training to support behavioral concerns in the classroom, but the good news is that we know what to do and have the research to prove what to focus on.  We start by talking with our students about their experience and what they would like to see change and co-design approaches together.  One of the most impactful things we can do is to make sure that everyone feels a sense of connection and belonging and that includes staff. Small things like welcoming students each day and learning their name and something personal about them, setting the stage for a nurturing environment.",

        "query": "Q4. Discuss the role of a school counselor within the integrated MTSS framework.",
        "response": " In the context of an Integrated Multi-Tiered System of Support (MTSS), a school counselor plays a crucial role in ensuring that all students receive appropriate academic, career, and social/emotional support. Here's a breakdown of their key responsibilities:\n\n1. **Standards-based school counseling instruction**: School counselors deliver lessons that address universal academic, career, and social/emotional development needs. These lessons are aligned with the school's academic standards and help students develop essential skills for success in school and beyond.\n\n2. **Data analysis**: They analyze data related to academic, career, and social/emotional development to identify students who may require additional support. This data-driven approach helps them target their interventions effectively.\n\n3. **Intervention strategies**: In collaboration with other school staff, they develop and implement research-based intervention strategies for students who are struggling. These interventions could range from small group counseling sessions to academic support groups.\n\n4. **Progress evaluation**: After implementing interventions, school counselors evaluate the progress of students to determine if the strategies are effective. If not, they revise the interventions as necessary.\n\n5. **Referral and collaboration**: When needed, they refer students to appropriate school and community services for additional support. They also collaborate with administrators, teachers, other school professionals, community agencies, and families to ensure that all students receive the necessary academic and behavioral supports.\n\n6. **MTSS design and implementation**: School counselors actively participate in the design and implementation of the school's MTSS framework. This includes advocating for equitable education for all students and working to remove systemic barriers that may hinder student success.\n\n7. **Advocacy**: They advocate for the needs of their students, ensuring that they have access to the resources and support they need to succeed academically and socially. This advocacy extends beyond the school setting, as they work to create a supportive learning environment both within and outside the school.\n\nIn summary, a school counselor's role within an integrated MTSS framework is multifaceted, encompassing instruction, data analysis, intervention, evaluation, referral, collaboration, design, implementation, and advocacy. Their primary goal is to ensure that all students receive the academic, career, and social/emotional support they need to succeed in school and beyond.",
