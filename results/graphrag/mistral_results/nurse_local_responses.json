        "query": "Q6. I saw a student in my office today who has clearly not showered in some time and seems to be wearing the same clothes for multiple days in a row. Is this an issue I should share during an MTSS team meeting? I am hoping to get her some additional help. Is it even ok for me to share this information because it is about a specific student?",
        "response": " It's important to approach such situations with sensitivity and respect for the student's privacy. While hygiene issues can be a sign of larger challenges, it's crucial to focus on the underlying causes rather than the symptoms.\n\nIn this case, you could bring up the student's performance or attendance concerns during an MTSS (Multi-tiered System of Support) team meeting, without disclosing personal details that might violate her privacy. Instead, you can discuss patterns you've noticed in her behavior, such as inconsistent attendance or a drop in academic performance, and suggest that these issues may be related to other factors affecting her life.\n\nIf you feel it is necessary to address the hygiene issue directly, consider reaching out to the school social worker or counselor for guidance on how best to approach this sensitive matter with the student. They can help you develop a plan to offer support and resources in a way that respects the student's dignity and privacy.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to remember that every student has unique circumstances, and addressing their needs requires empathy, understanding, and a collaborative approach. By focusing on the whole child and working together as a team, you can help create a supportive learning environment for all students."

This may include psychiatrists, psychologists, or social workers.\n\n10.
