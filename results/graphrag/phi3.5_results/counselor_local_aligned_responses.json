        "query": "Q1. I am a school counselor in a small school in rural area. The teachers in my school are really overwhelmed with behaviors that they are experiencing in the classroom.  Students are acting out, being rude to each other and the teachers, and not listening.  How can I help support the teachers and the students? Generally, most teachers have not been given proper training to support behavioral concerns in the classroom, but the good news is that we know what to do and have the research to prove what to focus on.  We start by talking with our students about their experience and what they would like to see change and co-design approaches together.  One of the most impactful things we can do is to make sure that everyone feels a sense of connection and belonging and that includes staff. Small things like welcoming students each day and learning their name and something personal about them, setting the stage for a nurturing environment.",
